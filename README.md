# React Web developer programming challenge

## Exercise Description

We would like you to demonstrate your abilities in creating functional React components using hooks.

### Basic Task

Your task is to develop a functional component (or components) in React using hooks to display a list of products fetched from the following API: https://dummyjson.com/products

### Extended Task

If you are able to complete the above quickly and correctly, we have a couple of additional features we would like you to implement:

1. The API supports skip and limit parameters. Please add a feature that allows the user to customize how many products should be displayed at once.

2. Add a feature that, when a user clicks on a product from the list, it displays all the images of that product.
